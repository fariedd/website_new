I'm Farisayi Dakwa, a Natural Scientist turned Data Scientist, leveraging a multidisciplinary background to solve complex data problems. My work has always been rooted in observation, experimentation, and analysis—whether tackling environmental challenges or driving data-driven decision-making in business.

My transition into data science started during my undergraduate internship, where I was introduced to data visualization and predictive modeling using R. That curiosity led me to take on a quantitative research-based master’s degree, analyzing 50 years of ecological data on endangered species in the Southern Ocean. Working with large datasets, time-series analysis, and machine learning pipelines opened up a new world of possibilities, and I fully embraced the shift into data science and analytics.

Now, I specialize in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data engineering, working with Python, R, SQL, and cloud-based tools to extract insights and build scalable solutions. My portfolio showcases real-world projects, from automated product classification models to interactive sales analytics dashboards, demonstrating my ability to blend scientific rigor with business impact.

This space is a living document of my journey—projects I’ve completed, methodologies I’ve explored, and new skills I’m developing. I'm always diving deeper into data science, MLOps, and AI-driven solutions, and I look forward to collaborating, learning, and pushing the boundaries of what data can do.

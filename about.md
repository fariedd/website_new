  You'll probably want to modify it in `about.md`, and maybe set `hide_description` to `true` in the front matter.

My name is Farisayi Dakwa, and I am a Natural Scientist who loves data. My job mainly involves observing and experimenting, employing a multidisciplinary approach to address environmental challenges and promote sustainable practices. Identify a problem, create a hypothesis, collect data on the issue, clean and analyse large amounts of data, visualise, interpret, and extract insights from the data to provide strategies for protecting and restoring biodiversity. During my internship as an undergrad, I got introduced to data visualisation and predictive modelling using R (l started in R but ended up in Python). I took statistics courses and l found myself wanting to engage more in data analysis and coding, l even took on a masters by research which was purely quantitative analysis (50 years of data) on endangered species in the Southern Ocean which opened up a new world of possibilities. So naturally, l decided to lean into it, dive fully into the world of data science, and deepen my knowledge of everything data.
This portfolio shows the projects l have completed, documentation of data skills, and learnings as l go deeper into this world. It is an exciting journey and l plan to keep adding to it. So, welcome, how can l help you with your dataâ€¦?

  about:             |
    l am a Natural scientist turned data scientist, who fell inlove with **everything data**! 
    l am passionate about machine learning, analytics, and scalable solutions. Always seeking opportunities to expand expertise in MLOps and real-world AI application for data solutions.
    Hobbies include swimming, chess, camping (manual car, offroad driving in the backwoods of nowhere) all that while consuming a ridiculous amount of books (probably reading fiction, Chigozie Obioma and Jordan Peterson are my favourite authors, for now...)

  about:             |
    Farisayi is a Natural Scientist who fell inlove with **everything data**! behind a white Nissan Hardbody NP300, tracking tagged buffaloes, where he learnt to analyse live telemetry data
    and determine species distribution of large herbivores in Hwange National park.  At any given time, you can find him buried behind a book (probably reading fiction, Chimamanda is his favourite author),
    swimming, chess or writing about life (a stream of consciousness). He would like to publish a book, a song and a short movie oneday :)

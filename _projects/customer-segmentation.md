In this project, I used the **K Nearest Neighbors** algorithm to understand how customers are shopping, and how lifestyle choices affect which food areas customers are shopping into.  
**Three main clusters** emerged from the data - **Cluster 0** accounted for **74%** of the database, while **Clusters 1 and 2** accounted for **15% and 12%** respectively. Digging deeper into the data, Cluster 0 represented customers who did not have any particular dietary preference. Cluster 1 saw high proportions of spend allocated to Fruit and Vegetables - it could be hypothesized that these customers are following a vegan diet. Customers in Cluster 2 spent significant portions of their total spend in Dairy, Fruit and Vegetables, but very little in the Meat area - signifiying that they are likely of a vegetarian bent.

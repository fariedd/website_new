### How I started

So I got interested in data science and machine learning quite by accident - a conference! Well, most of my job as a reservoir engineer in the Oil and Gas Industry involves extracting insights from data - but I mostly used Excel and Tableau. At a conference however, my eyes got opened to the world of Data Science and Machine Learning so I started to learn more. 

After going in a lot of rabbit holes on 'how to' advance my skillset, it all boiled down to a couple things: yes, do online courses but most importantly, keep doing projects and documenting them. Now I was good at the courses and starting projects but total rubbish at documenting my progress (mostly due to imposter syndrome and really, I didn't know how to start). 

A lot of Youtube videos and articles later (thank you ~Kenjee, the dataprof, dataslice), and a lot of learning on how not to do things (umm, failed attempts),   I took the step and started building my portfolio website. 

This is intended to be a guide if you are just starting out and intimnidated by the thought of building a website (what?!!!) and showcasing your work. Definitely not an exhaustive guide on the issues you may encounter, but my experiences and the resources and tools I found helpful along the way.
